# risk_analytics
Material for the 2017 Risk Analytics workshop for the University of Ljubljana, Masters in Financial Mathematics

## Tutorial problems and grading scheme

The tutorial problems for the first day are as PDFs here:
* Lecutre 1: https://github.com/munichpavel/risk_analytics/blob/master/risk_regulation/rrProblems.pdf
* Lecture 2:
https://github.com/munichpavel/risk_analytics/blob/master/correlated_default/corDefaultProblems.pdf

 The tutorial problems for the 2nd day are interspersed in the
 following notebooks:

* Lecture 3:
https://github.com/munichpavel/risk_analytics/blob/master/notebooks/nlp_examples_problems.ipynb
* Lecture 4:
https://github.com/munichpavel/risk_analytics/blob/master/notebooks/bitcoin_transactions_examples_problems.ipynb
* Lecture 4:
https://github.com/munichpavel/risk_analytics/blob/master/notebooks/bitcoin_link_prediction_examples_problems.ipynb

The number of points each problem brings is equal to $2^{number of
stars of the problem}$. For a grade of 8 you have to get at least 6 points, for grade 9 at least 7 points and for 10 at least 8 points. You have to solve one problem from each of the four sets of problems unless you solved one of the problems with three stars.

## Comments about code

For the first day, the examples in the lectures and the code snippets
for the tutorials were produced with R. The packages used are

* copula
* xtable
* dplyr
* ggplot2

The R code is in the repository folder `Day1_data_Rcode`.

For the second day, the examples from the lectures were produced using
Python 3.6. For basic setup with Python and Jupyter Notebooks (a
lightweight IDE to code and show your results), please see:

https://github.com/amueller/ml-training-intro

In particular, he shows with screenshots how to get a copy of the
material on a repository such as this one.

The tutorial problems for the second day are embedded in the notebooks
used to create examples for the lectures. These are:

In addition, I have very slighlty modified the `doc2vec-IMDB.ipynb`
notebook from gensim 

https://github.com/munichpavel/gensim/blob/develop/docs/notebooks/doc2vec-IMDB.ipynb
